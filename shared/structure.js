// structure_field — the griddled-building model's pure half (§11.4 discipline,
// sibling of models_field.js / flora_field.js / emitter_field.js).
//
// Given one `structure` component's data, decide EVERYTHING the world needs to
// know about that building: the boxes to draw, the boxes to collide, the rooms
// the walls enclose, and the doorways that join them. No THREE, no DOM, no
// scheduler, no colliders import — the hosted half (realize/structure.js)
// executes this plan; this half is the part a headless test can hold to the
// light (tools/structure-field-test.ts).
//
// WHY A GRID AT ALL. A conjured building is one opaque mesh: an agent can be
// told its bounding box and nothing else. It cannot ask which room it is in,
// what that room connects to, or where the door is, because none of that is
// written down anywhere — it is an emergent property of triangles. A griddled
// building writes the topology down, so "you are in the kitchen; the hallway is
// through the south door" is a DERIVATION rather than a guess. Everything in
// this file exists to make that derivation cheap and total.
//
// THE ONE LOAD-BEARING CHOICE: walls live on grid EDGES, not in cells. Sims got
// this right and every alternative goes wrong the same way. An edge is shared
// by exactly two cells, so a wall between the kitchen and the hall is ONE wall —
// it cannot be double-counted, cannot disagree with itself about thickness, and
// corners join because two edges meeting at a lattice point are exactly two
// edges meeting at a point. Cell-owned walls ("this cell has a north wall")
// need a rule for whose wall it is when both neighbours claim one, and every
// such rule leaks.
//
// COORDINATES. Cell (x, z) covers grid-local [x, x+1) × [z, z+1) on the ground
// plane. Edges are canonical by construction:
//   axis 0 — runs along X, from (x, z) to (x+1, z): the boundary between cell
//            (x, z-1) and cell (x, z).
//   axis 1 — runs along Z, from (x, z) to (x, z+1): the boundary between cell
//            (x-1, z) and cell (x, z).
// There is exactly one way to name any given edge, so no canonicalization pass
// is needed and no de-duplication can be forgotten. All coordinates here are
// GRID-LOCAL: a grid is an entity with its own position and yaw, and multiple
// grids at arbitrary angles to each other never need to agree about anything.

 *  AN APERTURE SPANS ITS WHOLE SEGMENT — it is one tile wide, exactly as in

 *  a 0.9m door in a 1m tile leaves 5cm jambs, and a 5cm box is far thinner than
 *  a 32cm body radius. The movement solver ejects a body through the NEAREST
 *  face, so a sliver jamb pushes you sideways ALONG the wall instead of back
 *  out of it — you slide through the doorframe rather than being stopped by it.
 *  Any jamb narrow enough to leave a usable door in a 1m tile is too narrow to
 *  collide correctly, so the honest answer is not to have one. The neighbouring

 *
 *  A quadrant box does neither. Its faces are coplanar with the walls' faces
 *  but ADJACENT rather than overlapping — they tile the plane instead of
 *  competing for it — and its end caps sit back-to-back with the walls', which
 *  backface culling resolves for free.

 *  in space, two different colours, and a visible step right at the opening.
 *
 *  Refining the profile fixes it from both sides: the ladder makes
 *  interpolation track the real curve, and putting a cut at every aperture
