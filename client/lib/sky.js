// frame budget on some machines.

// So every tier below 'high' now shows a BAKED sky instead of marching live
// (see sky_baked.js): the same march rendered once into the env-bake equirect
// and displayed on a static dome, re-baked only when the sky actually changes.
// The tier's cost moves from per-frame to per-bake, which is why 'medium'
// can afford the FULL 8-pass march — it looks better than the old live
// 3-pass tier and costs a texture lookup per pixel at runtime. The trade is
// stillness: clouds hold their shapes between re-bakes. 'high' keeps the live
// march (below).
//
// This is a CLIENT preference, not world state. It is deliberately never a
