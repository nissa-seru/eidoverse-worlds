// baked sky — the volumetric clouds as a texture instead of a per-pixel march.
//
// The cloud dome's raymarch re-shades every screen pixel every frame, but the
// sky it draws is a function of VIEW DIRECTION alone: the domes are
// camera-centred and the cloud shell is hundreds of metres up, so walking
// around a world produces no parallax a person can see. Re-marching a
// direction-only signal 60 times a second is where the frame budget went —
// measured here at ~120fps without clouds vs ~30 with.
//
// sky_system already knows how to render that signal into an equirect
// RenderTarget by explicit per-texel direction — bakeEnv(). This module shows
// that bake on a static dome and keeps it ALIVE:
//
//   - TWO targets, front and back. The dome cross-dissolves between them, so
//     the sky is always easing toward a bake a few seconds newer — clouds
//     keep their slow evolution (forming, growing, drifting) instead of
//     teleporting on every re-bake. v1 swapped one texture in place and the
//     cloud field's natural nucleate-and-grow read as stepwise jumps.
//   - Bakes are BANDED: the engine's cached bake material is re-rendered a
//     horizontal strip per frame (~2ms each) instead of one blocking
//     full-quad pass, which is what makes a 4096x2048 bake affordable — v1's
//     2048 was ~4x undersampled against the screen and read as mush.
//   - The freshest bake keeps feeding scene.environment and the reflection
//     hook's fallback, so IBL agrees with the visible sky.
//
// Still traded away, deliberately: per-frame lightning illumination INSIDE
// the clouds (bolts and the scene flash stay live; bakeEnv refuses to bake a
// lightning pulse), and the fine per-pixel shimmer of the true march. The
// live march remains the 'high' cloud-quality tier.
//
// Coupling note: this reaches through skyApi._internals (sky_worlds'
// declared engine-work escape hatch) for `sys.domes`, `sys._envTarget` and
// the cached `sys._envBake` {scene, camera}. If a toolkit update moves any
// of them, attach() returns false and sky.js stays on the live march —
// degraded performance, never a broken sky.
